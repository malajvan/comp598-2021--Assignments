There are some problems during the data annotation process that could affect the accuracy of counting. The Trump_mention field determination method might cause false estimation since, as one student pointed out in MyCourses discussions, for example tweets mentioning Trump's tweeter account are considered False under Trump_mention, so are possible typos and parody on Trump's name, leaving out a huge portion of tweets that should have been considered in the statistics, causing under-estimation.
